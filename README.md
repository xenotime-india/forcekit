# forcekit CLI

## Introduction
Sometimes it happens that due to lack of time or knowledge or in pressure we forget to follow the specified code quality standards which somehow impact the overall quality of the product. To measures the quality standards we are only left with the manually process of reviewing the code line by line which is time consuming as well as not that much reliable. 

So to figure out this issues I have come up with a tool named forcekit CLI, which is a code review tool that lets you scan your code for Apex, Visualforce and Lightning specific issues. It helps in identifying those loop holes (dirty code) which impact the overall quality of the product i.e. Its helps you to know where there is a need to improve your code to match the standard quality.

Itâ€™s a completely automated tool which will help you to enhance the quality of the code as well as of the product.

## Installation

install the forcekit CLI using the following command:

`npm install -g forcekit`

## This CLI tool uses the following major external libraries:

1. **jsforce** - JSforce (f.k.a. Node-Salesforce) is an isomorphic JavaScript Library utilizing Salesforce's API: It works both in the browser and with Node.js. [more details](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsforce)
2. **eslint** - ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.[more details](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint)
3. **PMD** - PMD scans source code in Java and other languages and looks for potential problems.[more details](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.5/index.html)

## Usage

After installation the forcekit CLI tool will be available to you. It is the entrypoint for all the functionality mentioned above.

You can call ````forcekit <command> --help```` to find out more about all of the following commands.
